# Fatal Traffic Accident Analysis (FARS)

## Project Overview
Fatal traffic accidents remain a major public safety concern in the United States. This project presents a comprehensive, data-driven analysis of fatal traffic crashes using the **2022 Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS)** dataset published by the **National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)**.

The objective of this project is to identify key risk factors associated with fatal crashes by analyzing demographic attributes, vehicle characteristics, environmental conditions, substance involvement, and safety equipment usage. The findings are supported by clear and interpretable visualizations designed to aid researchers, policymakers, and road safety advocates in making informed, data-driven decisions.
